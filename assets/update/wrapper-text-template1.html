<p>We recognize that gifts from alumni and friends are not only monetary contributions but also represent the gift of trust. The University of Chicago has a four-star rating from Charity Navigator, Americaâ€™s premier charity-rating body. A four-star rating means the organization exceeds industry standards and outperforms most charities in its cause.</p>
