<p><span style="font-size:12px">In 1970 Milton Friedman, AM&#39;33, famously wrote that the only social responsibility of business is to increase its profits. Forty-five years later, is this still a good rule to follow, in theory and/or in practice? Should corporations care about other objectives: from the welfare of its employees to the environment? Or should they distinguish between long- and short-term goals as Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, has suggested? Should there be any limit to the pursuit of profit maximization? The panel will discuss these issues and how corporations should be run in the 21st century.</span></p>
